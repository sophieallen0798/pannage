                    <h3>Our Story</h3>
                    <p>Pannage Pork is a family-owned farm dedicated to producing the finest quality pork through traditional and sustainable farming methods. Our name comes from the ancient practice of "pannage" - the historic right to pasture pigs in woodland during autumn to eat fallen acorns and beechnuts.</p>

                    <h3>Our Farming Philosophy</h3>
                    <p>We believe in raising our pigs in a natural, stress-free environment where they can exhibit their natural behaviors. Our pigs have access to woodland areas where they can forage and root, which not only keeps them happy and healthy but also contributes to the exceptional flavor of our pork.</p>
                    <p>We are committed to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ethical and humane treatment of all our animals</li>
                        <li>Sustainable farming practices that respect the environment</li>
                        <li>Producing high-quality, flavorful pork products</li>
                        <li>Supporting our local community</li>
                    </ul>
