                    <p>One farmer and some pigs roaming around a small farm in Oxford, North Carolina.</p>

                    <h3>What does pannage mean?</h3>
                    <p>Pannage is an old practice where pigs forage in woodlands, eating acorns, roots, and whatever else they find. It's how pigs were raised for centuries before factory farming took over. The name felt right for what I'm trying to do here.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="about-section">
                    <h3>How the Pigs Live</h3>
                    <p>The pigs here have space—real space. They're not stuck in pens all day. They root around, they run, they nap in the shade. It's a good life for a pig.</p>
                    <p>We keep the numbers small on purpose. Fewer pigs means we can take care of them properly and make sure each one is healthy and happy.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="about-section">
                    <h3>What They Eat</h3>
                    <p>The pigs get a mix of feed, forage, and food that would otherwise go to waste. We pick up unsold produce and scraps from local farmers markets—stuff that's perfectly good but didn't sell. The pigs love it, and it helps reduce food waste.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="about-section">
                    <h3>Location</h3>
                    <p>The farm is in Oxford, NC in Granville County. If you're local, you're welcome to come see the operation. If you're anywhere else in North Carolina, we can deliver.</p>
